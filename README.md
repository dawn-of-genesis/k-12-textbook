# k-12-textbook
Open source Khmer K-12 Textbook. Aims to provide high quality textbook for Cambodian students.

We contribute our bits and pieces of knowledge for the new generation children. As the saying goes, a thousand eyes see better than a pair.

In this project, we are going to compile a set of concepts that children should be learning from kidergarten to grade 12, the pinnacle of high school. Additionally, we are going to add in some other unprecedenced subject in Cambodia such as emotional control, moral, social and discipline.
